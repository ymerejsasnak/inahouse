    '''These are the main actors of the story (of course!).  All aspects randomized
    at instantiation.  Most 'traits' will be a value between 0 and 1.  Also some
    true/false personality flags (some of which may be rarer than others).  Also stores
    inventory if they pick up objects, method of speaking for dialogue and 
    catch-phrases if any.  Name, physical description, mood, memories, 
    typical behaviors, etc.  Shoudl there also be a protagonist flag to follow
    one main character, or should the narrative just jump around and follow them all?'''
