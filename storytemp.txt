	Three people found themselves in an unfamiliar house. They did not remember how they got there. We were quite careful in that respect. These three people did not know each other before ending up in this house. The windows and doors were sealed, allowing no escape. We were quite careful in that respect as well. 
	Certain items within the house were flagged by our algorithms as "notable." In the basement, there is a moldy blanket on a workbench. In the bedroom, there is a hand mirror on the bed. In the kitchen, there is a cracked glass in the fridge. In the bathroom, there is a half-full shampoo bottle in the sink. In the living room, there is a faded picture of someone's family on the coffee table.
