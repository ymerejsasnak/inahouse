	Three people found themselves in an unfamiliar house. They did not remember how they got there. We were quite careful in that respect. These three people did not know each other before ending up in this house. The windows and doors were sealed, allowing no escape. We were quite careful in that respect as well. 
	Certain items within the house were flagged by our algorithms as "notable." In the living room, there is a faded picture of someone's family on the floor. In the bedroom, there is a locked diary in the closet. In the kitchen, there is a cracked glass on the table. In the basement, there is a rusty hammer behind the furnace. In the bathroom, there is a sliver of soap in the sink.
