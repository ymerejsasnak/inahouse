	Three people found themselves in an unfamiliar house. They did not remember how they got there. We were quite careful in that respect. These three people did not know each other before ending up in this house. The windows and doors were sealed, allowing no escape. We were quite careful in that respect as well. 
	Certain items within the house were flagged by our algorithms as "notable." In the bathroom, there is a half-full shampoo bottle on the counter. In the kitchen, there is a cracked glass in the fridge. In the living room, there is a cracked porcelain angel on the mantle. In the basement, there is a bottle of bleach on the floor. In the bedroom, there is a single sock on the nightstand.
