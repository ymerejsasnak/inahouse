	Three people found themselves in an unfamiliar house. They did not remember how they got there. We were quite careful in that respect. These three people did not know each other before ending up in this house. The windows and doors were sealed, allowing no escape. We were quite careful in that respect as well. 
	Certain items within the house were flagged by our algorithms as "notable." In the living room, there is a cracked porcelain angel on the coffee table. In the bathroom, there is a half-full shampoo bottle on the counter. In the kitchen, there is a piece of rotten meat on the counter. In the bedroom, there is a single sock in the closet. In the basement, there is a rusty hammer on a workbench.
