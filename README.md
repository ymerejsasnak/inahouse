NOTE:  OK, I SEE NOW AFTER DOING SOME READING ONLINE THAT I MUST HAVE GOTTEN THIS
IDEA BY READIN ABOUT DARIUS KAZEMI'S "TEENS WANDER AROUND A HOUSE"
...but this will be different...and it's more programming learning/practice for me anyway

code to generate a short story with objects and variables and randomness and other yummies
(clarification:  'short story' not in a traditional, truly meaningful sort of way, 
but far more in an 'experimental fiction' sort of vein...)

[[[find a markdown reference...forgot everything!!!!!!]]]

objects involved (each in individual files with more descriptions therein):
story: controls the interaction of other objects and the generation of the text
setting: the object that defines a room/contains the rooms (we'll see...)
character: randomized people that act according to various variables and whatnot
item: 'object' in the physical world sense...things for the characters to interact with

big goals/ideals: 
1 - to make the code have enough randomness and possibility within it that 
each run will generate a unique (enough) story to make me (or whomever) want to 
generate multiple stories to see what each one turns out like
2 - even more hopeful yet important: have enough complexity in the way the various
objects interact, enough variability etc, that the stories that are generated
actually SURPRISE me in joyful/absurd/creepy/funny/whatever ways

(the above may be far beyond my abilities...but we shall see what I can do...)




TO DO NEXT!

-implement basic items
-fix narration/dialogue to fit with story (3 strangers awake in a house)
-work on dialogue trees
-implement actions
